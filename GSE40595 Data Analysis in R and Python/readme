The mission of The Falsone Protein Database is to provide the scientific community with a freely accessible information on protein kinases, the phosphosites they relate to as well as human kinase inhibitors. Quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis allows users to process thier own experimental data to get a summary of the relative activity of human kinases in their dataset, among other information.
